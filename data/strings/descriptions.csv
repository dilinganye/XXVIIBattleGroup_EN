SGB_planet1_description,CUSTOM,"As a StarFortress which been abandoned long times ago, huge of military installation had be set on. After a long period of restoration work by the 27th Group, the vast majority of facilities in this star fortress have resumed operation, including the energy consuming planetary shield.

The core of the Shackles Garrison is located here, and ships are completed day and night from the shipyard. A large amount of mineral deposits are rapidly consumed, and everything on the entire planet is prepared for revenge.

Due to its strong militarized management, the black market does not exist on this planet.",,"The red planet shield wraps around the entire planet like a spider web. The planet was originally an abandoned starcastle, but was ultimately driven by the flames of the Shackles Garrison Army. You can see a large number of ships being cast in various parts of the planet, and the entire planet's minerals being recklessly mined. Countless buildings are disorderly but orderly filling all the gaps. You heard that all of this was completed in less than one ephemeris year.

This is the new capital of the Shackles Garrison Army Group.

Because there is an extremely terrifying regulatory system here, no pirate can survive for two days after successfully infiltrating. Most Luddite individuals live in various places where they will kill themselves to continue achieving their goals - you are certain that no black industry chain can be formed here.

This planet once witnessed the end of an era; And now it has witnessed the rise of the Shackles Garrison Army Group. Here, the Shackles Garrison may regain the title of their name of Battle Group and create their new history.",,
SGB_planet3_description,CUSTOM,"The weather here is incredibly hot, and the entire planet's residential areas heavily rely on habitats deep underground for their livelihoods. Most transactions and external communication are conducted through space stations in orbit.",,"You feel as though you're on the verge of experiencing a hallucination.

The planet's atmosphere exhibits a peculiar transparency under the intense heat, causing everything to appear distorted - before you've even descended in the shuttle.

The weather is unbelievably hot, with numerous sandstorms and waves of acid dust sweeping the globe, forming vast, shifting mountain ranges in the sky. The planet's settlements heavily depend on life support systems deep underground. Most transactions and external communications are conducted through space stations in orbit.",,
SGB_resourcesPlanet_description,CUSTOM,"Some planets have already been surveyed, but have not been developed by the Shackles Garrison Army.",,,,
SGB_planet_aouintes_Mission_Finish,CUSTOM,"The former capital of the Shackles Garrison Group Army, when the Shackles Garrison Group Army was engaged in a local conflict with Tri-Tachyon, the Hegemony fleet took advantage of the situation and launched orbital bombings here.

The unit of Shackles Garrison - codenamed Forging Hammer Mobile Group - quickly responded, but when they broke through the blockade and reached the orbit of the planet-
They only saw a sea of flames filling the entire planet.

The angry remnants of the Shackles Garrison launched a decisive battle against the hegemony main fleet - with the sole purpose of killing enemy ships, without considering their own survival. Although the hegemony fleet effortlessly cleared this desperate fleet, it still lost several dozen warships.

The atmosphere of the planet has been depleted in that disaster, and the previously abundant organic matter has turned into lava on the surface or smoke and dust in the sky. At the same time, a large amount of minerals that were once mined have become powder mixed with the air, forming this pink glow under the Tyndall effect - but also causing lethal levels of atmospheric pollution.

According to the official explanation of the hegemon, it was a tactical bombing.",,,,
SGB_planet_aouintes,CUSTOM,"The former capital of the Shackles Garrison Group Army, when the Shackles Garrison Group Army was engaged in a local conflict with Tri-Tachyon, the Hegemony fleet took advantage of the situation and launched orbital bombings here.

The troops stationed along the Shackles Garrison had not had time to react before the entire planet was destroyed by the overlord's bombing.

The planet's atmosphere had been exhausted in that disaster, and the originally abundant organic matter had completely disappeared in the burning. A large amount of previously mined minerals had turned into powder and mixed with the air, forming a deadly level of atmospheric pollution.

According to the official words form the hegemon, it was a tactical bombing.",,,,
SGB_planet6_platform,CUSTOM,"This outpost is located in a relatively remote location and is expected to fall into its parent star due to magnetic field effects in the near future. Although it has been abandoned, its exterior maintenance is quite good. But of course, for you, this is an ideal storage space that can avoid the trouble of warehouse tariffs.",,"There are still the necessary facilities for ship maintenance inside, and most of the cabins remain in good condition. You speculate that someone must have used this place before.

As your survey team delves deeper into exploration, fragmented bodies marked with the logo of employees from Suzi Technology start to appear in areas that are poorly maintained. There are also numerous signs of ships making emergency takeoffs - several gaping wounds torn from the inside by chain guns and traces of antimatter engine burns left on them, while some of their ships seem not to have taken off successfully.

There were also many personnel who appeared to belong to the 27th Battle Group - this was learned after the exploration team scanned more identity cards of the drifting bodies in the deeper areas.

Perhaps a major battle took place here, or maybe a mutiny? But regardless, they seem to have left something behind, and you are certain that these items will be far more helpful to you than those ancient stories.

[Upon first arrival at this storage point, you can obtain some resources left by predecessors]
You can maintain your ship here, or store a large amount of items.",,

SGB_Ampoist_station,CUSTOM,"The research fortress, once struck by Shackles Garrison, is still able to operate barely normally today. Before the attack, it could regularly produce certain scientific research results.

However, with the strike from Shackles Garrison, a large number of scientific research facilities were irreversibly damaged, and now, this place is essentially non-existent in name only.",,"The fortress is riddled with numerous patches, and many areas still bear signs of ongoing construction. The battle that took place there was said to be extremely fierce. The shock ammunition used by the 27th combat group directly overloaded the space station's shield system, causing a massive electrical backflow that nearly completely incinerated the internal research modules.

Following this, a large number of fighter jets acted entirely on the principle of extermination measures, turning all the shuttles attempting to evacuate into explosions mixed of flesh and blood under the barrage of Vulcan cannons.

After that incident, Suzi ceased to invest much capital in this space station.",,
SGB_Ampoist_station_Capt,CUSTOM,"The research fortress, once struck by Shackles Garrison, has undergone extensive militarization adjustments after being seized by the 27th Battle Group. It has now completely transformed into a combat fortress.

The former research facilities have been stripped of residual information, and the excess parts have been melted into metal plates for the production of ships and ammunition.",,"The fortress is riddled with numerous patches, and many areas still bear signs of ongoing construction. The battle that took place there was said to be extremely fierce.

SGB,FACTION,"Shackles Garrison is a battle group which once considered disconnected, and holding ships using the Midline ways. Shackles Garrison did not care about the Domain is the legitimate actual rulers like the Hegemony - because they are not being find after they are lost after the Collapse; They also do not want to use the power to solve problems in the beginning, since cooperate is the way to solve conflict. But for the chaotic Perseus, standing the line not absolutely is absolutely not standing in line; After a series of small and large local conflicts, the 27 battle group eventually became even more sunken, but the radical faction was always ready to use terrorism to seek revenge.
Due to fighting on two fronts, the Shackles Garrison suffered significant losses and had to withdraw from the core star domain, retreating to a small military galaxy controlled by them to bide their time.",,,,

SGB_Shackles_MissileLauncher,WEAPON,"The Whiplash MRM launcher, as a built-in missile launch platform, has suppressive long-range defense capabilities. Although these launched missiles can only cause certain fragments of damage under normal circumstances, they can exert terrifying air superiority when facing unscheduled carrier based aircraft and less dense missiles. The self tracking system of the Whiplash MRM launcher has been specialized for small and medium-sized missile targets, and its ability to lock onto ships has been forcibly locked after a test to prevent accidental attacks on our damaged ships.",,,,
SGB_MeltingMold_Launcher,WEAPON,"Melting-Mold EDL Launcher is a miniature plasma gun, and its miniaturization process greatly limits its actual output. The unique charging requirements also make it impossible to mass produce or load during combat; But setting aside these factors, the unique launch mode of investment EDL gives it a unique backflow capability - once the projectile comes into contact with the ship, a large amount of unstable amplitude energy flow will rapidly sweep the entire ship.",,,,

#战机联队,,,,,,
SGB_Drone,SHIP,"A rather basic type of drone, widely used on many ships in Shackles Garrison - mostly for logistics and transport, with very few actually militarized enough to be directly deployed on the battlefield; the weapons carried by this drone entirely depend on what weapons were in a premium at the time of production, making it hard to define its actual role on the battlefield. Its most distinctive features are the small thermal decoy launcher and the entire body's power grid being utilized to supply a small-scale shipborne weapon, which almost renders it devoid of Flux, speed, and virtually everything else.",,,,
SGB_Agatha,SHIP,"This type of LPC can activate modifications on other models aboard the Shackles Garrison carrier. The Agatha-class is a versatile asset, equipped with an integrated decoy launcher that can divert defensive fire away from itself or high-value targets.

The Ares-class multi-machine decoy launcher will greatly interfere with the enemy's point defense system, allowing it to have more robust and sustained output when seizing air superiority and suppressing enemy shields. Two Pins can quickly evaporate targets that have lost their armor from the battlefield, while the Den carried by the machine helps it to quickly penetrate the enemy's armor.",,,,
SGB_Axio,SHIP,"This LPC can activate modifications of other models on the Shackles Garrison carrier. The unique rotary-wing engine of the Axio-class gives it extremely strong mobility. Compared to rockets, the designers of Shackles Garrison unsurprisingly chose missiles as the mounted ammunition. All these are designed to ensure that this fighter jet can preserve itself as much as possible in the battlefield full of gunfire and cause as much effective damage as possible.",,,,
SGB_Argion,SHIP,"The Argion-class's unique modular system allows for various configuration models. Specialized bodies can accumulate gradually accelerating energy—essentially becoming faster over time. This often enables the effective execution of Hit&Run tactics. Moreover, thanks to its unique missile self-production system, it doesn't need to return to the ship for replenishment like other bombers. All pilots operating this type of carrier-based aircraft must understand reverse maneuvers to ensure the smooth recovery of both the aircraft and pilots after battle.",,,,

#战机变种,,,,,,
SGB_Ares_Coop,SHIP,"The Ares-C04 model, codenamed Ares-C04, boasts its greatest advantage in the two broad-spectrum side-mounted machine guns it carries, capable of quickly suppressing enemy shields. Additionally, the mounted ion cannon can also paralyze the enemy ship's engine in critical moments, or gain an upper hand during interception.",,,,
SGB_Ares_DogFight,SHIP,"The Ares air superiority model, codenamed Ares-S79; this carrier-based aircraft bears little resemblance to its original model, with substantial changes in its appearance and system making it a completely different entity at various levels - an aerial mine interceptor.",,,,
SGB_Ares_Assault,SHIP,"The Ares strike model, designated as Ares-A08; compared to the original model, it sacrifices some top speed in exchange for more powerful protection and even more terrifying firepower. Small ships are insignificant in front of its three built-in grenade guns, and when facing heavily armored ships, it can quickly become a thorn in their side with the help of a magazine accelerator.",,,,
SGB_Agatha_Coop,SHIP,"Agatha's collaborative model, codenamed Agatha-C09; although its side-mounted degradation device is called a blatant rip-off of the ion beam, in terms of actual production cost and practicality for fighter jets, it far surpasses the achievements set by its predecessor. In aerial combat and against ships, it always leaves enemies struggling to counteract.",,,,
SGB_Agatha_DogFight,SHIP,"Agatha's air defense model, code-named Agatha-D30, is designed for saturation anti-aircraft defense. Relying on its three needle-sentinels, a turret system with no fixed slots, and an extra-tuned point defense AI system, the Agatha-D30 can quickly vaporize a large number of passing missiles and lightly armored targets in aerial combat.",,,,
SGB_Agatha_Assault,SHIP,"Agatha's strike model, codenamed Agatha-S71; This carrier-based aircraft has little to do with the original model, and its substantial changes in shape and system have made it something completely different at all levels - an extreme gunship. In order to quickly evaporate the enemy's exposed armor, each carrier-based aircraft is equipped with two small cannons, these single-shot stable weapons can pose a serious threat to targets with thicker armor.",,,,
SGB_Axio_Coop,SHIP,"The collaborative model of Axio, codenamed Axio-S02; this carrier-based aircraft bears almost no resemblance to the original model. Its significant changes in appearance and system make it an entirely different entity at every level - an extreme energy projector. However, due to this weapon still being too space-occupying for bombers, it still needs to get close to within nearly 300su before it can fire on carrier-based aircraft.",,,,
SGB_Axio_DogFight,SHIP,"Axio's air superiority model, codenamed Axio-D51; this carrier-based aircraft has discarded the original model's bomber armament and has been forcibly welded with numerous anti-aircraft weapons such as anti-aircraft guns, allowing it to assist the fleet in interception like an external gun turret.",,,,
SGB_Axio_Assault,SHIP,"Axio's striker model , codenamed Axio-K02; this carrier-based aircraft has little to do with its original model. Its extensive changes in appearance and system have made it a completely different entity at every level - a large melting beam gunboat. Its primary combat style is to rely on strong defensive capabilities to forcibly approach enemy ships, and to instantly melt enemy ships with built-in terrifying beams.",,,,

SGB_FerricOxide,WEAPON,"It is almost a miniaturized ion beam, and although the large exposed structure makes it not very attractive, it can quickly reduce the possibility of weapons overheating and self melting by relying on this most primitive means.",,,,
SGB_Temperom,WEAPON,"A black box weapon with unknown principles, but can be produced; The particle beam it emits is destructive to most existing armor layers, and its massive energy particles will destroy the stability of the armor molecule structure, followed by disintegration and melting.",,,,
SGB_Curlor,WEAPON,"A steel needle launcher specifically designed for fighter jets, invented by a company that closed down several decades ago due to losing a commercial lawsuit, but this weapon is still being used by the Shackles Garrison.",,,,
SGB_Barb,WEAPON,"A type of small artillery, equipped with a self reactive warhead, since then, it still can exhibit a relatively stable trajectory and considerable lethality at this size.",,,,
SGB_Screws,WEAPON,"A more effective rigid warhead small light machine gun, with screws that are basically similar to light machine guns circulating on the market, but the latter's weapon AI system prioritizes point defense, unlike the former - screws focus on their actual job, which is to prioritize anti shield strikes.",,,,
SGB_ScrewsTwi,WEAPON,"A more effective rigid warhead small double barreled light machine gun, with twin screws that are basically similar to the light double barreled machine guns circulating on the market, but the latter's weapon AI system prioritizes point defense, unlike the former - twin screws focus on its actual job, which is to perform anti shield strike tasks first.",,,,
SGB_AirGrenade,WEAPON,"A well-designed joint air laser silo system, due to the loss of corresponding ammunition production blueprints in the chain defense, can only carry the most common Stinger Class air mine on the market after certain processing; In practical terms, throwing many air mines on a single plane to blow up enemy carrier based aircraft will never go out of style.",,,,
SGB_SGL,WEAPON,"A small railgun used to shoot high explosive grenades at a high speed. Because of the size, it is mainly mounted on carrier based aircraft.",,,,

SGB_Fighter_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"By utilizing strong spatial resonance to block nearby particles, the damage received by this ship's strike crafts can be reduced by about 30% for a very short period of time, but those crafts cannot fire during this period.",,,,
#船只简介,,,,,,
SGB_Anoyas,SHIP,"The Anoyas-class was originally a small modular transport ship, bearing some resemblance to the Bison. Shackles Garrison made adjustments to the original combat vessel and transformed it into an extremely efficient transport ship, modified for cargo transport. Its ample armament makes it less susceptible to pirate attention. However, regardless - the Anoyas-class remains merely a civilian-grade vessel, with its heavy weapon load significantly impairing its mobility. It requires a brief overload of the power system to respond adequately. When the missiles are depleted, the end is near for the Anoyas-class.",,,,
SGB_Anoyas_Tanker,SHIP,"The Anoyas-class was originally a small modular transport ship, bearing some resemblance to the Bison. Shackles Garrison made adjustments to the original combat vessel and transformed it into an extremely efficient transport ship, modified for fuel transportation. Its ample armament makes it less susceptible to pirate attention. However, regardless - the Anoyas-class remains merely a civilian-grade vessel, with its heavy weapon load significantly impairing its mobility. It requires a brief overload of the power system to respond adequately. When the missiles are depleted, the end is near for the Anoyas-class.",,,,
SGB_Buffalo,SHIP,"Currently, the star domain is not only filled with risks and violence, but the majority of conflicts often erupt instantly due to a mere speck of resources or slight disdain. Since military-grade ships cannot always arrive at the scene in time, some clever engineers have turned to modifying originally non-threatening civilian hulls to meet these needs.

Although it was improved from the Buffalo-class hull frame, its modification range is quite bizarre, hence this ship is also recognized as a vessel of no use. Relying on the space carved out from transport effectiveness for carrier-based aircraft, it fails to perform well in transportation tasks, yet can only play a minimal role in combat.",,,,
SGB_SoftMelting,SHIP,"As a reinforced version of the Phaeton-class, the Softmelt-class possesses superior protective capabilities that its predecessor lacked. These additional armors have occupied much of the space originally designed for old turrets and broadside tubes, but they also equipped it with an automatic loading missile system. For safety reasons, the storage for flammable and explosive materials - heat decoys, was replaced with more stable engine facilities, enabling the Softmelt-class to possess strategic relocation capabilities in perilous battlefields.

That said, fundamentally, the addition of extensive armor is not a very reasonable operation. This modification has somewhat reduced the already limited cargo hold capacity of this ship, as well as its poor broadside performance.",,,,
SGB_Mould,SHIP,"The Mould-class is a well-known variant of the heavy freighter, equipped with numerous missile launchers and an integrated drilling shockwave for mining operations. Its built-in Lupus missile magazine is directly connected to the internal nanoforge, allowing the Mould-class to provide support from a distance when transport fleets are attacked.",,,,
SGB_Ceaies,SHIP,"To address the growing issue of piracy in the outlying star systems, the 27th Battle Group has approved an armament reform for the Duplin-class. The resulting design, the Ceaies-class corvette, has been mass-produced. Compared to its predecessor, it features significant changes, including a well-isolated engine, a more industrial appearance, modular design for easy maintenance, and numerous weapon slots that have successfully endowed it with a degree of excellent escort capabilities.",,,,
SGB_Duplin,SHIP,"The Duplin-class underwent extensive modifications from the Kite-class, as streamlined designs are not as significant in a zero-gravity environment. The designers of the Chain Guard Corps made sweeping changes to the interior space of the Kite-class, adding two gun emplacements and incorporating a pair of machine guns for counterattacks against enemies. However, the top-mounted turret was ultimately removed to allocate space occupied by the new weaponry within the ship.",,,,
SGB_Redmond,SHIP,"This vessel is not large in size, but its internal space planning is quite interesting. At the same time, its small missile launch module can allow it to target enemy small ships to a certain extent. However, as a transport ship itself, it is not sturdy - once its armor is penetrated, any artillery fire can quickly evaporate its highly efficient structure.",,,,
SGB_Felix,SHIP,"The spatial planning within the Felix-class is quite intriguing, and it comes equipped with a pair of missile modules - when paired with ships that can apply pressure to enemy shields, the Felix-class always finds the opportunity to unleash a barrage of fire.",,,,
SGB_Wiesios,SHIP,"Thanks to the entire ship being designed around its extremely volatile engine, the Wiesios-class boasts superior speed among escort ships. Additionally, its weapon system utilizes a control module similar to that of the Hammer-class, enabling the Wiesios-class to harass the enemy with burst fire when facing certain firepower, and assist friendly capital ships. A group of Wiesios-class ships can occasionally also directly take out isolated enemy vessels.",,,,
SGB_Sumner,SHIP,"The Sumner-class boasts a plethora of slots and excellent armor among frigates. It excels at harassing the enemy with powerful missile projectile fire; however, some captains prefer to pilot it directly into the face of the enemy, utilizing its efficient burst capability to instantly destroy opponents.",,,,
SGB_Posmous,SHIP,"The Posmous-class is equipped with a pair of railguns at the front of the ship. This is also the main reason it was ultimately classified as a light destroyer - length. Thanks to the unique engine design of the Posmous-class, it has good maneuverability in combat, and its specially tuned shields can react more quickly. Generally, this type of ship is mainly used for support and torpedo launching, but due to its simple deployment characteristics, it is quite versatile in practical application.",,,,
SGB_Hammies,SHIP,"The Hammies-class has inherited the advantages of its prototype, the Hammer-class, and further enhanced its protective capabilities. Although this has somewhat reduced maneuverability, the isolated engine design minimizes issues with ship engines disconnecting due to fighter interference, while still maintaining the ship's top speed unchanged compared to its prototype. The Cambridge located at the front of the ship has been moved to the rear, providing a better field of view and allowing for a new weapon mount point at the front. This makes it more adept at engaging in ship combat tasks within groups of fighters.",,,,
SGB_Ogent,SHIP,"Ogent-Class's most distinctive feature is its unique built-in missile. This high-strength armor-piercing steel needle will pose a threat to the enemy no matter what - hitting the shield or directly damaging the structure. The ship itself has good cruising speed, and it always has a good effect when pursuing and killing enemy ships. In most cases, it will work with wolves to quickly tear apart enemy's large ships.",,,,
SGB_Davington,SHIP,"=Should have been kicked off= The Davington-Class possesses fierce missile projection capabilities. An experienced captain will drive this ship to fiercely pursue and annihilate enemy ships, but will choose the right timing, as the Davington-Class does not have an excellent point defense system. Its built-in Typhoon-Class Reaper Torpedo is a major weapon for securing victory.",,,,
SGB_Whip,SHIP,"The Whip-Class features a unique built-in missile launcher, excelling in providing combat support from the rear of the battlefield. It can also charge into the fray carrying massive endgame strike torpedoes, pushing through enemy ships torn apart by these torpedoes; in most cases, the Whip-Class's distinctive defensive missile launchers can handle a large number of missiles or fighter squadrons from the enemy, thereby creating favorable conditions for assaults by other ships.",,,,
SGB_Aligate,SHIP,"The Aligate-Class and the Alicuty-Class are very similar, but different from the latter. This ship leans more towards an aircraft carrier role, with its deck and maintenance facilities easily supporting the needs of two squadrons of fighter jets.",,,,
SGB_Alicuty,SHIP,"The Alicuty-Class and the Aligate-Class are very similar, yet distinct from the latter. This ship is more inclined towards a destroyer position, with its compressed deck space only able to support the deployment of one squadron of fighter jets. However, the additional gun turrets and the freed-up internal space allow it to perform more diversely in battle.",,,,
SGB_Falcon,SHIP,"It is evident from the appearance that its base design is a Falcon-Class light cruiser. This Falcon-Class received a system reconstruction and modification from Shackles Garrison, which somewhat compromised the ship's theoretical top speed and energy limit. However, thanks to the specialized engines from Shackles Garrison, the ship's full-speed maneuverability before an engagement slightly outperforms the older models. Yet, once engaged with the enemy, it struggles to disengage quickly.",,,,
SGB_Falcon_2,SHIP,"The appearance clearly indicates that its base design is a Falcon-Class light cruiser. This particular Falcon-Class underwent system reconstruction and modification from Shackles Garrison in its early stages. Subsequent restorative construction also brought back the ship's fundamental performance metrics. Additionally, it was equipped with defensive missiles - Whip. Thanks to the specialized engines from Shackles Garrison, the ship's full-speed maneuverability before an engagement significantly surpasses that of the older models from the 27th.",,,,
SGB_Eagle,SHIP,"At first glance, it is evident that its base design is an Eagle-Class cruiser. This Eagle-Class has undergone a system overhaul from Shackles Garrison, which to some extent diminishes the ship's theoretical top speed and energy capacity limits. However, thanks to the specialized engines from Shackles Garrison, the ship's full-speed maneuverability before engaging in battle slightly outperforms the older models. Yet, once it gets entangled with the enemy, it struggles to disengage quickly.",,,,
SGB_Eagle_2,SHIP,"At first glance, it is evident that its base design is an Eagle-Class cruiser. This Eagle-Class vessel underwent a systemic rebuild by Shackles Garrison in its early stages, and subsequent restorative constructions have restored the ship's fundamental performance metrics. The ship has also been equipped with additional small defensive missiles. Thanks to the specialized engines from Shackles Garrison, the ship's full-speed maneuverability in pre-combat situations is superior to the older models of the 27th.",,,,
SGB_Carving,SHIP,"The Carving-Class possesses an unreasonable size among cruisers, serving as a special option for the Shackles Garrison to evade regulations on large ships. After this class of ship was officially commissioned, many captains found that the systems of the Carving-Class were not complex - at least not as difficult to modify as those of the main battleships. Therefore, in the fleet, many captains were willing to modify the security system circuits of this ship. The authorities introduced strict laws in response - because such illegal modifications could damage the lifespan of the ship and seriously, blatantly expose the true combat capabilities of the Shackles Garrison disguised by this vessel.",,,,
SGB_Achilles,SHIP,"Thanks to its ample slots, the Plasma Burst Drive allows it to easily approach enemy small ships and destroy them in an instant; On the battlefield, Achilles-Class ships are often piloted by the most aggressive captains, who frequently use various techniques to overtake them and turn them into a terrifying high-speed hunter on the battlefield.",,,,
SGB_Ascaedy,SHIP,"The Ascaedy-Class boasts a concentrated and dense weapon configuration, while also sparing space for carrier-based aircraft. The built-in gun turret spiral system endows it with exceptionally superior reaction capabilities. As a type of aviation cruiser, the role of the Ascaedy-Class on the battlefield is straightforward - charge to the front line, then attempt to tear open a gap in the enemy's formation with its intense firepower.",,,,
#SGB_Anvil,SHIP,铸砧-级具备优异的导弹投射能力，其火力配置极为凶残 - 搭载了大量高速装填导弹系统，并具备相当罕见的淬火部署系统；设计上，铸砧-级往往应该位于前线附近提供支援，但几乎所有舰长都更乐意冲上去使用其搭载的凶残炮火快速解决问题。得益于其具备的大量高速装填导弹模块，铸砧-级即使在面对小船集群时也有着相当快速且主动的应对能力。,,,,
SGB_Anvil,SHIP,"The Anvil-Class, serving as a military logistics transport ship, possesses an unimaginably superior missile deployment capability. Its Quench Deploy is extremely fierce - equipped with numerous high-speed missile nests and a rather rare quenching deployment system; in design, the Anvil-Class often acts as a slow fire support point, temporarily unloading cargo when necessary, and relying on its own armor to forcefully charge into enemy lines with the assistance of other ships. Thanks to its large number of high-speed reload missile modules, small escort wolf packs find it difficult to inflict decisive damage on the Anvil-Class without paying a price.",,,,
SGB_Stress,SHIP,"Stress-Class further extends the glory of the Eagle family, with its good mobility and diverse assembly methods allowing it to take on many roles on the battlefield - although in most cases it assumes the position of long-range suppression, and immediately changes position in emergencies; under the tactical transformation of the 27th, it can break into the center of the battlefield alongside cruiser-Class ships in an encounter, and then establish a solid bridgehead.

The design of the Stress-Class was completed while Shackles Garrison was en route to Perseus, with initial verification and mass production taking place at the capital Aouintes. The existing blueprints were lost following the Hegemony's strike operation against the capital. This ship represents an original model that still possesses its initial theoretical combat capabilities. Often, the Stress-Class is considered robust enough to serve as an upper-tier successor to the Eagle-Class, despite the consequent increase in maintenance costs, which are, however, entirely within acceptable limits compared to other battleships. While the slot allocations in many flagships might seem modest, the Stress-Class's decent base amplitude, coupled with its mobility, ensures stable firepower for these slots and pursuit effectiveness under special circumstances.

Its biggest issue, and a frequent complaint from logistics personnel, pertains to the demand for armor maintenance - primarily painting and regular upkeep of protective layers. This necessity arises from its wing engines, fully integrated within the armor on both sides, and the constant heat they generate, almost clinging to the ship's armor layer. Consequently, it has earned the dubious distinction of being nicknamed ""Self-Destructive Armor Class"" among maintenance crews across the galaxy.

Although it is a Battleship form Shackles Garrison, there is no build-in missiles, a novel thing it is.",,,,
SGB_Stress_2,SHIP,"This Stress-Class ship is a rare original model from the early days of Shackles Garrison, having undergone only the necessary adjustments to accommodate contemporary weaponry. Compared to most existing Stress-Class ships, this vessel boasts significantly enhanced attributes across the board; its exceptional maneuverability and a wealth of adaptive tactics enable it to fulfill multiple roles on the battlefield - whether in support, suppression, or elimination. Under the tactical modifications of the 27th, it can charge into the heart of the battle alongside cruiser-Class ships during skirmishes and subsequently establish a solid bridgehead.

SGB_Onslaught,SHIP,"A design of historical renown. Thanks to the Onslaught-Class's simple maintenance system, mass production and deployment remained feasible; as Shackles Garrison focused more on the construction of Onslaught doctrines, this variant of the Onslaught-Class sacrificed a lot of armor and internal resistance structures in favor of mobility and numerous missile strike modules. However, thanks to its modified superior engines, the Onslaught-Class could always arrive at the front lines in time, breaking through enemy lines with a barrage and missiles that outnumbered the enemy's by several times.

When the Onslaught-Class was first launched from the orbital shipyard, this colossus, dwarfing surrounding ships, caused the entire star domain to tremble. There were even rumors that they were created in a long-forgotten war to serve as the mainstay against alien species. Later, engineers from the Domain of Man improved its blueprints by not only adding shield systems and upgrading hyperdrive engines but also reducing the number of necessary crew members through automation and iterative engineering. Even with other more advanced capital ship blueprints available, the Onslaught-Class remains one of the easiest capital ships to produce today due to its extremely simple system.

This warship, which did not consider shields in its design, could rely solely on reliable armor to protect the crew to the greatest extent while enduring fierce firepower and organizing effective counterattacks, thus winning the affection of officers and crew members. Despite relying on a large amount of ammunition supply for logistics, its unparalleled frontal firepower allows the Onslaught-Class to destroy entire fleets within minutes.",,,,
SGB_Forgnace_Battle,SHIP,"The Forge-Class, an exceptionally adept maneuvering battleship, was designed from the outset to form high-speed strike teams that could rapidly breach enemy defenses and achieve tactical objectives before the enemy could respond. Notably, its built-in Stibene-reaction shaped charge serves as a specialized missile for targeting large enemy vessels, capable of forcibly breaking through defensive lines led by enemy flagships in many situations. The most criticized aspect of the Forge-Class is that its extensive internal structures, exposed for dispersion purposes, make the seemingly thick armor difficult to utilize effectively.

The design of the Forge-Class dates back to before the collapse of the Stargate, when Shackles Garrison was still serving under the military system of Humanity's domain. Under urgent combat requirements, it developed a firepower ship exclusive to the 27th Army Group. At that time, the Forge-Class carried a large number of interstellar missiles that are now impossible to replicate. Due to the loss of manufacturing techniques, all current Forge-Class ships have adopted a new form of cruise missile - with equal power but limited quantity.",,,,
SGB_Forgnace,SHIP,"Forge Fortress-Class is an experimental derivative design of the Forge-Class, essentially a fusion between a capital ship and an aerial fortress, equipped with as diverse an armament as possible without significantly compromising reliability. The Forge Fortress-Class is reportedly removed from the Shackles Garrison's organization, yet there are still a few reports claiming that in extremely rare instances - a Shackles Garrison fleet led by an intact Forge Fortress-Class still undertakes certain secret missions in outer star systems.
The design of the Forge Fortress-Class was spearheaded by an unverifiable research group following the resounding success of the Forge-Class and the Malleability-Class designs. Judging solely by the outcome, if logistical issues causing serious problems are disregarded, they must have achieved success.",,,,
