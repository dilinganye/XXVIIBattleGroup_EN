SGB_station4,SHIP,"A space station designed inline with the carrier strike doctrine, and the revenge weapon of the Shackles Garrison - The Undefeatable Citidel possesses terrifying fighter projection abilities, and massive batteries of various kinetic weapon can place a huge flux pressure on all enemy ships, before the fighter swarm shread them all.

The ludicrous desing of this station was shocking: radical Shackle Garrison commanders wanted to use graviton sling to launch the station into the Hegemony capital, and use this as the forward base for their reprisal. However, given the cost and technological challenge involved, the plan was put on halt - but never fully rejected.

Now the platform serve as habitat, shipyard, factory and storage, able to project both military and industrial power within its orbit.",,,,
SGB_station4_ITS_MOVING,SHIP,"A space station designed inline with the carrier strike......By the dominion, why is it moving! Run for your lives! ",Only exists in theory.,Unknown Entry,,
SGB_Duplexing_ChainGun,WEAPON,"A retractable rapid fire cannon designed for assualt ships, thanks to its unique blowback mechanism, the weapon can be caliberated with each shot, and the excessive gas can be used to load the next shell - though this violent desing also means the weapon barrel will wear out after a few dozen shots, making this weapon a hot potato for logistic staffs. 
",,,,
SGB_Roller,WEAPON,"Originally a jury-rigged torpedo by the Shackle's Garrison - not recognized by the military and well known for being set off by any impact, the weapon was eventually stablized somewhat by the engineer corp. By ionizing massive amount of graviton and shoving it all into a torpedo rated as being stable for the engineering corp, this is what you get.

One of the moste hated design by logistic departments of the sector - regardless of whether they are maintaining this weapon or maintaining whatever got burned to a crisp because of this. 
",,,,
SGB_ArcFurnace,SHIP,"A mass produced assualt ship by the Shackles Garrison, its pair of chaingun can let out a terrifying volley in a short time to shread any armor, and give other ship and strikecraft an opening to deal damage. Given its relatively cheap cost and good performance, it can be found in many merc fleets. 
",,,,
SGB_Cupola,SHIP,"Bigger, harder, and more surivable super freighter. This fully militarized Cupola class is able to carry slightly more cargo than the Atlas, but has far superior protection when compared to its fragile counterpart. Even if caught in a fight, the Cupola's powerful base spec can invalidate harassment by most smaller ship. That said, it is only a matter of time for a civilian freighter to be destroyed by firepower of a large military vessal. ",,,,
SGB_Zircon,SHIP,"The Zicron class destroyer straddled the line between civilian and military use, with many arguing for its proper role. Though given the disabler torpedo and steady performance in combat, a sudden apperance by a Zicron in combat can often fry the expensive systems hidden behind the enemy hull.

A light and small destroyer, it is usually just a token representation of security for small civilian fleet, with mediocre performance. - Until a juri-rigged frontier weapon was mounted on it. ",,,,
SGB_Danburite,SHIP,"The name is imposing but serving on this ship is often considered a crappy assignment. It is only slightly better protected than some freighter - and that is accounting for all that side armor. Given the builtin cannon, the interior is almost hallowed out. Meaning the ship can be shallowed in an instant by most standardized explosive in the sector. Then again, this ship is dirt cheap and does not have a demanding logistic profile, making it a decent choose for fleet looking for fire support - but still terribly recieved by the crew.

The ship is not able to travel far on its own, so usually used as small firebase in fleet with some logistical abilities. 
",,,,
SGB_Penetrator,SHIP,"Not really useful in a fight, but thanks to their stable shield generator, these petite drones can sometime absorb massive singe shot firepower by sheer luck - like eating one reaper torpedo as it overloads. 
没什么作战能力，但得益于稳定的护盾发生器，这种小巧的无人机可以在某些时刻撞大运般在过载前吃下巨大的单发火力 - 例如一发将它砸过载的死神鱼雷。",,,,
SGB_wolf,SHIP,"Very similar to the wolf, but the Alpha Wolf is actually a re-imagining of the Wolf concept drawing. Lavish spending on apperance did not only improve the ship's looks, its spec across the board is also slightly superior. On the other hand, as it never entered mass production, it is fairly rare to find one.
",,,,
SGB_Graviton_pulse,WEAPON,"A very rare find in the sector that shares the same design philosophy of the ion beam. Though compared to sustained suppresion, this weapon overloads its rate of fire to massively increase the force applied by particles on the shield....its probably easier to just think of it as a burst ion beam.",,,,
SGB_Tutia,WEAPON,"The only thing stronger than missiles is more missiles. Following this logic, the Tutia MIRC have a terrifying damage potential. Poorly 
guided rockets are strpped enmass ona  drone, which carries out target locking. The barrage of rocket fire will shread the poor drone, and whatever target is in front of them. ",,,,
SGB_Homunculus,SHIP,"Homunculus - A man-made being in alchemy. This is a very rare encounter in the sector, it is rumored to contain a drone nano-factory allowing this destroyer to fight head on against cruisers. In battle, a ship like this can disrupt, interrupt, and shread any enemy tactical plans, and the Tutia MIRV system can launch a rain of missiles to destroy any smaller ship daring to harass.

In many ways, it extended the Shackles Garrison's favourtism for missiles. ","Unknown ship

SGB_Transmutation,SHIP,"Transmutation - an alchemical term meaning changing of one substance to another. This ship shares simularity with many ship in the Shackles Garrison but the actual number in the sector is very low. Based on available information, it is suited to rush in combat and use its shielding to cover bombers to rapidly destroy enemy.

While this close range bombing doesn't quite fit the Shackle's Hit&Run strikes, it is still a kind of strike doctrine. ","Unknown ship

SGB_Cupola_P,SHIP,"Modified by the former Redstone Crystal Taskforce, with large amount of flight decks and firepower installed, and a more striking apperance. - Unlike other pirate products, former RCT ships are well maintained. 

Bigger, harder, and more surivable super freighter. This fully militarized Cupola class is able to carry slightly more cargo than the Atlas, but has far superior protection when compared to its fragile counterpart. Even if caught in a fight, the Cupola's powerful base spec can invalidate harassment by most smaller ship. That said, it is only a matter of time for a civilian freighter to be destroyed by firepower of a large military vessal. ","Unknown ship

SGB_Fleamut_P,SHIP,"Modified by the former Redstone Crystal Taskforce, completely reworked shield logic, and a more striking apperance. - Unlike other pirate products, former RCT ships are well maintained. 

The Flemut class is a more strike-oriented modification of the Sunder, with extreme modifcation without regard to cost. Although most of the ship's internal structure have been taken up to install its unique mobility system and some weapon slots are lost, these changes does not change the ship's excellent burst damage capabilities. Several Flemut can isolate and shread and enemy like a pack of hyenas before leaving them a mangled wreck following an explosion.

Though the Flemut designw as finalized long ago, few anticipated the ship to turn out the way it did. The Sunder was only selected as the ship's basis as a chat within the design bureau, and the ship system is just a beneifical system error arising out of the Hammies system upgrade. In the end, the Shackle's engineers did everything they could to reproduce and stabilize that system error, resulting in this terrifying design. ","Unknown ship

SGB_Carving_P,SHIP,"Modified by the former Redstone Crystal Taskforce, it uses tech recovered from strike against tri-tachyon forces to upgrade the ship's engine and a more striking paint job. - Unlike other pirate products, former RCT ships are well maintained, but due to a lack of replacement parts, the builtin PD array is rmeoved and the space used to optimize the ship's flux grid. 

Were it not fitted with cruiser-level hullmod ports, there is no way the Carving Class would be called a Cruiser. The ship's built-in PD array has staaggering recoil, but it also can make a large volume its facing into a no-fly zone with terrifying efficiency. Any cluster of small missile or poorly armored strike craft squadron will drown in an ocean of frags in an instant. 

After the ship has formally entered service, many captain realized that the system of the Carving class is not that complicated - at least not as hard to modified as those of the capital ships. Accordingly, modifying the ship's safety system became a hobby of many radical crews. This lead to the admiralty issuing a correspondingly strict laws - given the effect these practice has on ship life, not to mention it clearly exposed the actual capability of the ship, something the Shackles Garrison wishes to conceal.

SGB_Serpentine,WEAPON,"A heavy aerial bomb, filled with colloid mixture that will be instantly spread into the vaccum, followed up by a particle shockwave - extremely deadly to target forced to keep up their shield in a fight.",,,,
SGB_WingRail,WEAPON,"Instead of an fighter mounted weapon, it is more apt to call this a weapon mounted fighter. The weapon takes over half the hull of the fighter and the massive rail can launch the projectile far, with great penetration. 
",,,,
SGB_Ares_Coop,SHIP,"Ares' collaborative model, codenamed Ares-C05; although its side-mounted degradation device is called a blatant rip-off of the ion beam, in terms of actual production cost and practicality, it far surpasses the achievements set by its predecessor. In both dog fights and anti-ship action, it can use its excellent roll ability to pressure the enemies. The extra weapon also gives it plenty of options in a close range fight, making it a true multi-role - with the exception if the weakness of its fragile hull meaning most head on assualt will result in heavy lossess. ",,,,
SGB_Agatha_Coop,SHIP,"Agatha's Collaborative model, named Agatha-C10; this craft almost bear no reselmblance to the original model. Its massively revamped hull and system makes it an entirely new craft on several levels - namely a railgun support craft that is more like a drone turret. It can provide constant suppresion against targets within in range, often being enough to keep an opponent from charging into the vessal it is escorting. Though the complex system requirement also made it a logistic sinkhole. ",,,,
SGB_Agatha_Assault,SHIP,"Agatha's Collaborative model, named Agatha-C10; this craft almost bear no reselmblance to the original model. Its massively revamped hull and system makes it an entirely new craft on several levels -  An extreme pressure fighter, made to rapidly destroy enemy shield. Every fighter carries an Edge Cutter needler and a Serpentine Resonance Aerial Bomb these terrifying kinetic firepower can collapse an shield at an instant. Even if the opponent choose to turn their shield off, the massive bomb can still deal considerable damage to targets - not to mention the rest of the fleet can capitalize on this opening. ",,,,
SGB_Microhierax,SHIP,"Most defensive module of this ship is not much to write about, but the builtin timeflow system and massive amount of weapon mount in the front of the ship allow it to display strength unmatched by most high tech ships. Though given the ship never entered mass production, it is a very rare find in the sector.

SGB_planet1_description,CUSTOM,"As a star fortress which had been abandoned long times ago, many ruined military installations can be found when the Shackles Garrison first discovered this planet. After a long period of restoration work by the 27th Group, the vast majority of facilities in this star fortress have resumed operation, including the energy-consuming planetary shield.

The core of the Shackles Garrison is located here, and ships are completed day and night from the shipyard. A large amount of mineral deposits are rapidly consumed, and everything on the entire planet is prepared for revenge.

Due to its strong militarized management, the black market does not exist on this planet.",,"The red planet shield wraps around the entire planet like a spider web. The planet was originally an abandoned starcastle, but was ultimately commandeered by the Shackles Garrison. You can see a large number of ships being cast in various parts of the planet, and the entire planet's minerals being recklessly mined. Countless buildings are disorderly but orderly, filling all the gaps. You heard that all of this was completed in less than one ephemeris year.

This is the new capital of the Shackles Garrison.

Because there is an extremely terrifying regulatory system here, no pirate can survive for two days after successfully infiltrating. Most Luddite individuals live in various places where they will kill themselves to continue achieving their goals - you are certain that no black market can be formed here.

This planet once witnessed the end of an era; And now it has witnessed the rise of the Shackles Garrison. Here, the Shackles Garrison may regain the title of their name of Battle Group and create their new history.",,
SGB_planet3_description,CUSTOM,"The weather here is incredibly hot, and the entire planet's residential areas heavily rely on habitats deep underground for their livelihoods. Most transactions and external communication are conducted through space stations in orbit.",,"You feel as though you're on the verge of experiencing a hallucination.

The planet's atmosphere exhibits a peculiar transparency under the intense heat, causing everything to appear distorted - before you've even descended in the shuttle.

The weather is unbelievably hot, with numerous sandstorms and waves of acid dust sweeping the globe, forming vast, shifting mountain ranges in the sky. The planet's settlements heavily depend on life support systems deep underground. Most transactions and external communications are conducted through space stations in orbit.",,

SGB_planet_aouintes_Mission_Finish,CUSTOM,"The former capital of the Shackles Garrison Battlegroup, when the Shackles Garrison Battlegroup was engaged in a local conflict with Tri-Tachyon, the Hegemony fleet took advantage of the situation and launched orbital bombings here.

The unit of Shackles Garrison - codenamed Forging Hammer Mobile Group - quickly responded, but when they broke through the blockade and reached the orbit of the planet-
They only saw a sea of flames filling the entire planet.

The angry remnants of the Shackles Garrison launched a decisive battle against the Hegemony main fleet - with the sole purpose of killing enemy ships, without considering their own survival. Although the Hegemony fleet effortlessly cleared this desperate fleet, it still lost several dozen warships.

The atmosphere of the planet has been depleted in that disaster, and the previously abundant organic matter has turned into lava on the surface or smoke and dust in the sky. At the same time, a large amount of minerals that were once mined have become powder mixed with the air, forming this pink glow under the Tyndall effect - but also causing lethal levels of atmospheric pollution.

According to the official explanation from the Hegemony, it was a tactical bombing.",,,,

The troops stationed along the Shackles Garrison had not had time to react before the entire planet was destroyed by the overlord's bombing.

The planet's atmosphere had been exhausted in that disaster, and the originally abundant organic matter had completely disappeared in the burning. A large amount of previously mined minerals had turned into powder and mixed with the air, forming a deadly level of atmospheric pollution.

You speculate that someone must have used this place before.

As your survey team delves deeper into exploration, fragmented bodies marked with the logo of employees from Tri-Tachyon start to appear in areas that are poorly maintained. There are also numerous signs of ships making emergency takeoffs - several gaping wounds torn from the inside by chain guns and traces of antimatter engine burns left on them, while some of the ships seem not to have taken off successfully.

There were also many personnel who appeared to belong to the 27th Battle Group - this was learned after the exploration team scanned more identity cards of the drifting bodies in the deeper areas.

Perhaps a major battle took place here, or maybe a mutiny? But regardless, they seem to have left something behind, and you are certain that these items will be far more helpful to you than those ancient stories.

[Upon first arrival at this storage point, you can obtain some resources left by predecessors]
You can maintain your ship here, or store a large amount of items.",,

However, with the strike from Shackles Garrison, a large number of scientific research facilities were irreversibly damaged, and now, this place basically exists in name only.",,"The fortress is riddled with numerous patches, and many areas still bear signs of ongoing construction. The battle that took place there was said to be extremely fierce. The shock ammunition used by the 27th combat group directly overloaded the space station's shield system, causing a massive electrical backflow that nearly completely incinerated the internal research modules.

Following this, a large number of fighter jets acted entirely on the principle of extermination measures, turning all the shuttles attempting to evacuate into explosions mixed of flesh and blood under the barrage of Vulcan cannons.

After that incident, Tri-Tachyon ceased to invest much capital in this space station.",,

SGB,FACTION,"The Shackles Garrision is a mid-tech battlegroup that was once thought lost. However, the sudden occurence of the Great Collapse meant no organization had the means or intention to look for them. From the perspective of the Shackles garrison, they are just a fleet abandoned after an ordinary excercise. This ultimately lead to the shackles garrison renouncing their original title - 27th Battlegroup of the Shackles Strike Force. Making them essentially highly organized deserters; Though research of the garrisson eventually cleared up the history - they were not abandoned out of malice. But all the various issue that arose cannot simply be addressed in such a short time.In the end, Shackles Garrison decided to forget it all and spent the rest of their existence in a nearby sector.

Unlike the Hegemony, the Shackles Garrison care not for the legitimacy of the Domain. Afterall, it is the Domain who abandoned them after they went AWOL. This means they care not for the continuation of Domain rules; nor do they have any thought of rulership over the sector, but instead prefer to cooperate with various factions. That is, after all, the best way to resolve conflicts.

For the chaotic persean sector, it is best to avoid taking a side if it can be helped. After a series of local conflicts, the enraged Shackles Garrison formally declared war against Tri-Tachyon and the Hegemony, but maintaiend fairly normal relation with the league.In the end, fighting on two front caused the Garrision to suffer massive losses and forced them to withdraw from the core sectors. They now stand guard in a small militarized system under their control, biding their time.",,,,

Currently, the Persean sector is not only filled with risks and violence, but the majority of conflicts often erupt instantly due to a mere speck of resources or slight disdain. Since military-grade ships cannot always arrive at the scene in time, some clever engineers have turned to modifying originally non-threatening civilian hulls to meet these needs.

Although it was improved from the Buffalo-class hull frame, its modification range is quite bizarre, hence this ship is also recognized as a vessel of no use.

Later, engineers from the Domain of Man improved its blueprints by not only adding shield systems and upgrading hyperdrive engines but also reducing the number of necessary crew members through automation and iterative engineering. Even with other more advanced capital ship blueprints available, the Onslaught-Class remains one of the easiest capital ships to produce today due to its extremely simple system.

This warship, which did not consider shields in its design, could rely solely on reliable armor to protect the crew to the greatest extent while enduring fierce firepower and organizing effective counterattacks, thus winning the affection of officers and crew members. Despite relying on a large amount of ammunition supply for logistics, its unparalleled frontal firepower allows the Onslaught-Class to destroy entire fleets within minutes.",,,,
SGB_Forgnace_Battle,SHIP,"The Forge-Class, an exceptionally adept maneuvering battleship, was designed from the outset to form high-speed strike teams that could rapidly breach enemy defenses and achieve tactical objectives before the enemy could respond. Notably, its built-in Stibene-reaction shaped charge serves as a specialized missile for targeting large enemy vessels, capable of forcibly breaking through defensive lines led by enemy flagships in many situations. The most criticized aspect of the Forge-Class is that its extensive internal structures, exposed for dispersion purposes, make the seemingly thick armor difficult to utilize effectively.

The design of the Forge-Class dates back to before the collapse of the Stargate, when Shackles Garrison was still serving under the military system of Humanity's domain. Under urgent combat requirements, it developed a firepower ship exclusive to the 27th Army Group. At that time, the Forge-Class carried a large number of interstellar missiles that are now impossible to replicate. Due to the loss of manufacturing techniques, all current Forge-Class ships have adopted a new form of cruise missile - with equal power but limited quantity.",,,,

SGB_Forgnace,SHIP,"Forge Fortress-Class is an experimental derivative design of the Forge-Class, essentially a fusion between a capital ship and an aerial fortress, equipped with as diverse an armament as possible without significantly compromising reliability. The Forge Fortress-Class is reportedly removed from the Shackles Garrison's organization, yet there are still a few reports claiming that in extremely rare instances - a Shackles Garrison fleet led by an intact Forge Fortress-Class still undertakes certain secret missions in outer star systems.

The design of the Forge Fortress-Class was spearheaded by an unverifiable research group following the resounding success of the Forge-Class and the Malleability-Class designs. Judging solely by the outcome, if logistical issues causing serious problems are disregarded, they must have achieved success.",,,,

Due to the loss of many important maintenance devices during XXVII Battle Group's exile, the only remaining ship capable of carrying this facility is the Hydrargyri-Class. Furthermore, the entire ship's flux dispersion network has been integrated into the Taiyi system, meaning that during the activation and cooling period of this system, the ship will be extremely vulnerable.

The name of the Taiyi System is said to derive from extremely ancient alchemical technology, and the entire research on the Gold Element by Shackles Garrison is built upon this foundation.",,,,
