Known for their lack of scruples, these experienced mercenaries tend to be excluded from consideration for tasks requiring a modicum of respectability, resulting in most employment offers being for jobs that other mercenaries refuse to be associated with. Known as 'upwind' or 'aloof' teams, they leave very little standing in the aftermath of completing their assigned tasks.",
