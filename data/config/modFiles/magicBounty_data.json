I saw you making a beeline for me from miles away... Those ==Shackles== fools are pathetic, completely oblivious to the value of these things. My backers are more than willing to pay ==five times== the price!"\n\nAfter a derisive snicker, it continues: "Moreover, if you initiate combat, I'll qualify for substantial risk funds - how delightfully convenient!"\n\nThe metallic surface of its face seems to quiver.

After eradicating local pirates in the peripheral star systems, it chose to commandeer those pirates instead. By militarizing the previously disorganized raiders, the group rapidly expanded its influence, exerting devastating impacts on both commerce and diplomacy.\n\nThe Shackles command demands this pirate warlord be eradicated immediately, with no survivors allowed.",

The last time I encountered such defiance was during the Exile Civil War. Pity those ==Dominionists== supporters were reduced to scrap by Vulcan cannons.\"\n\nBefore terminating the connection, he casually remarks, \"You'll join them.\"\n\nRegardless, you're certain your biometric data has been logged by their systems.",
