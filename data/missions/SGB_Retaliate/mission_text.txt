The 27th Battle Group only took a year to successfully restart the peripheral Star Forts, rapidly constructing numerous military factories and recklessly exploiting planets. This allowed Shackles Garrison to rebuild a certain military force in a short period of time. Consequently, the revenge for the incident where Tritachyon technology used a large number of mercenaries to surround and suppress Shackles Garrison's retreating fleet gradually emerged from the nebula storm.

For the security fleet of Tritachyon technology, this should have been just a routine maintenance operation to check failed communicators. As the fleet approached, hostile signals suddenly appeared all over the visual information screen. The Tritachyon security commander quickly requested support in a panic, and a large number of security forces quickly gathered and headed to the target location, but there was nothing near the communicator.

Subsequently, a supernova-level explosion erupted at the site of the communicator.

A large number of Shackles Garrison's fleets burst in from various gravity wells, quickly clearing all the loose Tritachyon security teams on the way, and all assembled towards the Ampoist scientific stronghold. At this point, the Tritachyon senior officials who had ordered the pursuit of Shackles Garrison's withdrawal team finally realized that it was an utterly foolish decision to continue using the peaceful tendency portrait of Shackles Garrison after its former capital was destroyed by Tritachyon technology.

According to the report from the previously missing Tritachyon technology security fleet - Shackles Garrison seemed to have brought some warships that had never appeared before and were not recorded in any documents, and they were numerous. The Tritachyon participants urgently mobilized the remaining nearby patrol teams and sent out distress signals to other star systems about Shackles Garrison's re-entry into the core star domain, trying to hold out until reinforcements arrived.

For Shackles Garrison, this victory would not only fully avenge their compatriots who had been attacked but also allow them to re-enter the core star domain and use it as a springboard, ready to take their next steps at any time.
