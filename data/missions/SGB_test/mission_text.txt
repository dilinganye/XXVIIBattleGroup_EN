> Sir, this is the ship data report you requested. We have done our best to collect everything - yes, that's all. Gelwin stayed up until today's fifth shift from yesterday to finish writing these things; he is currently in the infirmary, and I am planning to go check on his condition - if you have no objections, sir.
> Basic background
Shackles Garrison is a combat group of the Midline-style, once thought to be lost.
Unlike the Hegemony, Shackles Garrison doesn't care about the legitimacy of human dominion - since they weren't retrieved after being lost, their interest in ensuring human dominion is nonexistent;
They have no intentions for galactic hegemony and are quite happy to build good cooperative relationships with various forces, as they see that cooperation often solves disputes.

But for the chaotic Perseus, not taking their side absolutely means absolutely not taking their side;
After a series of small and large local conflicts, an angry Shackles Garrison officially declared war on Tri-Tachyon and the Hegemony, but still maintained relatively normal diplomatic relations with the Persean League.
Ultimately due to fighting on two fronts, Shackles Garrison suffered huge losses and had to withdraw from the core systems, retreating to a small military star system and waiting for an opportunity.

The Shackles Garrison Maneuver Theory is the main combat style of the 27th Combat Group. Unlike the "Decisive Battle" doctrine of the 14th Combat Group, Shackles Garrison places more emphasis on mobility and hit-and-run tactics; accordingly, their ships are designed with missile launch modules and rapid mobility capabilities even in zero empowerment state. Their ships also have superior transition performance compared to other ships as well as better missile guidance systems.

> History and Current Status
Shackles Garrison - once also known as the 27th Combat Group - lost hope in human dominion after the Great Collapse and subsequent loss of contact, prompting their fall into a state of self-destruction.
A period of excessive indulgence completely broke the backbone of the entire combat group.
Eventually, a great person - but unfortunately, no records have preserved his/her name - led a strike team that cleared the corrupt upper echelons of the fleet and quickly reestablished new control.
Subsequently, the entire combat group was unified and renamed themselves as Shackles Garrison. They embarked on an unknown journey, with their fleet ultimately arriving at Perseus.
Sadly, this was only a short-term halt to the impact of degeneration - after all, degeneration is a poison, and it will eventually poison everyone.
Today, many institutions within the entire army group are still filled with waves of nihilism, causing many to embrace hedonistic tendencies and causing tensions with the Luddites as a side-effect.
Even after arriving in Perseus, the group seems to remain the grips of a fundamental doubt. This lack of coherent, strongly-held values has also impacted their relations with others; they have tried to cooperate with other forces, but the Hegemony's suspicion, the Persean League's lack of opinion, and even Tri-Tachyon's extreme capitalism have difficulty interfacing with the Shackles Garrison's uncertainty.

They might have thought about it, or not; they might believe they will find a place to settle down, or perhaps not. Regardless, they are here.
