Location: Somewhere in {Hyperspace}
Date: {Unknown}

After the capital was destroyed, {Shackles Garrison} was thrown into complete disarray for a while. Eventually, with the help of the {Persean League}, they were able to re-establish their command structure. Though it was embarrassing, the only option available was to temporarily withdraw from the {Core Star Region} and search for potential refuge in the peripheral star systems.

{Shackles Garrison} had surveyed many planets and star systems even when they were still based in the core star region, among which was a military fortress planet that had not been explored by any faction. Unfortunately, the path to there would inevitably pass through the control area of the {Hegemony}; worse yet, news of {Shackles Garrison}'s planned withdrawal suddenly spread—initially thought to be due to an internal traitor, but later investigations revealed that it was all the work of {Tritachyon technology}.

When the {Hegemony} learned of {Shackles Garrison}'s plan to leave the core star region, they made certain concessions—according to {historians}, the main reason was the previous {capital bombing incident}—guaranteeing a ceasefire with {Shackles Garrison} to allow them to withdraw on their own, while {Tritachyon technology} quickly drafted various agreements, summarizing as follows:
1.Substantial reparations
2.Transfer of all existing chain garrison blueprints and corresponding technologies

{Shackles Garrison} humbly accepted the olive branch offered by the {Hegemony} and politely declined the related agreements from {Tritachyon technology}; for {Tritachyon technology}, this negotiation ended in discord.

{Andelon} was originally the captain of the {Blood Drip·Fighter Squadron}. In a previous operation, his fighter team successfully destroyed a carrier fleet of {Tritachyon technology} during a conflict, bringing considerable trouble to him and his squad. Free mercenaries hired by {Tritachyon technology} came one after another; although the squad eventually defeated them, only {Andelon}’s deputy—the fourth squadron leader {Erubolie} remained. Since {Shackles Garrison} had been defeated, their special unit seemed meaningless—moreover, the squadron had been annihilated, leaving them and their crews as the only remaining members of the squadron.

Due to repeated harassment by {Tritachyon technology} mercenaries, upon learning of {Shackles Garrison}'s withdrawal plan, the two quickly found an opportunity to sneak into a small fleet that had delayed its departure due to some ships being anchored for repairs; their special status granted by the official easily allowed them to deceive the escort fleet's identity checks, making up an excuse to leave the tumultuous core star region—the peripheral star systems, no matter how bad, wouldn't constantly have people wanting to take your head for tens of millions of star coins.

But bounty hunters would, and as long as the price was right, they wouldn't consider the impact—even further hostilities between {Shackles Garrison} and {Tritachyon technology}.

This unfortunate withdrawal team could never have imagined just how valuable the heads of these two stars were; news of {Tritachyon technology} mercenary attacks on the withdrawal fleet was quickly relayed to the nearest other escort fleets, but due to the prolonged delay, no one was confident they could return in time before this withdrawal fleet was completely wiped out; {Andelon} and {Erubolie} hadn't expected their whereabouts to be exposed—in fact, bounty hunters had already laid ambushes around various withdrawal fleets, they just happened to bump into this one—these two {special warfare soldiers} didn't have the withdrawal destination coordinates, those were only accessible to various dignitaries, transmitted unidirectionally and encrypted to other fleets, led by a mercenary leader codenamed "Dolphin"—this team didn't have many ships, but they were well-trained and received private sponsorship from {Tritachyon technology}; they had been waiting here for a long time. If this fleet was completely destroyed, then the two could be considered utterly finished.

The battle had been ongoing for a long time, {Andelon} and {Erubolie} struggled to integrate the remnants of this {Shackles Garrison} withdrawal team, the once large fleet had been destroyed by the enemy, leaving few survivors. But as long as we can immediately rush towards the distant hyperspace storm—and use it for rapid travel, then perhaps we can create distance from the enemy.

Regardless, maintaining the morale or lives of this withdrawal fleet that had collapsed more than once is crucial; protecting them at all costs is imperative. The enemy's main ship theoretically cannot catch up to us, which might be good news. However, if ship losses continue—then unidirectional target communications will become unstable, and the slightest navigation deviation could lead to encirclement by more bounty troops along the way, rendering all efforts futile!

    -But don't actually die, it's not worth it.
