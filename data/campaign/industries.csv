Continental plates have been massively reinforced and compartmentalized to preserve combat effectiveness against all orbital bombardments except direct planet-killer strikes. Regional command centers dubbed ""Continental Pillars"" dominate each sector, while streets swarm with military police and informants.

This militarization frenzy has granted Shackles overwhelming manpower reserves - particularly the infamous ""Blackshirt Internal Corps"" that never enters open markets, notorious throughout the Perseus Sector for resolving conflicts with brutal efficiency.",20,EXTREME

Now sits immobilized above Shackles' new capital as an impregnable defensive installation - at least according to historical archives.

Its presence nullifies any orbital bombardment attempts.",,EXTREME
